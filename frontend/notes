please close your tags
use classes instead of incline css

css for the popup does not work
cant use forms

Would be ideal if get-host-meetings came like this
{
    events:[{
        eventName:"Event 1",
        eventTime:" 20/02/21 : 1600",
        tag:"Tag1",
        eventID:3452345
    }],
    tags:["", "", ""]
}

join-meeting api call
{
        meetingCode: "",
        companyID:-0,
        username:"",
        anonymous: false
    }
