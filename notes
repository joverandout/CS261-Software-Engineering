DBSep - Deutche Bank Software Engineering Project - still need a name

Prerequisite Installs:
npm

Website to start with

otherwise clone the git and run npm i (i think) in the dbsep directory. Still read that though ^

We're using react because anything that requires interactiveness will be aided by using react. So this technically doesn't need to be a strictly react app, 
but i feel like this will be easier

This is also why we're not using typescript, for ease of use :D

Also note that we need to import React inside any file that uses JSX. otherwise it's not necessary
